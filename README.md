# Student Performance Dashboard ðŸ§ âœ¨

Ever wonder what really drives student success? Is it just about studying, or do cognitive skills like attention and focus play a bigger part? I built this project to explore that very question. This dashboard dives into a student dataset to uncover the hidden connections between how students think and how they perform.

## What It Does

* **Visualizes Connections:** Interactive charts that show the link between skills like attention and test scores.
* **Discovers Student Personas:** Groups students into different learning profiles, like "High Achievers" or "Distracted Learners."
* **Predicts Future Scores:** Uses a simple AI model to see if we can predict student performance based on their skills.
* **Lets You Explore the Data:** A clean, searchable table to look up individual students.

## My Process & Tech Stack

This project was a fun mix of data science and web development.

First, I put on my data scientist hat and used a **Jupyter Notebook** with **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Scikit-learn** to analyze the data, build the predictive model, and create the student personas.

Then, I switched to my web developer role to build the dashboard itself using **Next.js**, **React**, and **Tailwind CSS**. The beautiful charts are powered by **Recharts**, and the whole thing is deployed live with **Vercel**.

## Get It Running on Your Machine

Curious to run it yourself? It's pretty straightforward.

1.  **Clone the project:**
    ```bash
    git clone [Your GitHub Repo Link]
    ```
2.  **Jump into the folder:**
    ```bash
    cd student-performance-dashboard
    ```
3.  **Install all the needed stuff:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Start it up:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    You should see it running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## What I Learned from the Data

After digging into the numbers, a few key stories emerged.

1.  **Attention is Everything:** It turns out that a student's ability to pay attention was the single biggest factor linked to their test scores. It even beat out comprehension! It's a great reminder that creating a focused learning environment is incredibly important.

2.  **Not All Students Are the Same:** The data clearly showed a few distinct "types" of learners. We had the all-rounders, the students who understood concepts well but struggled to focus, and others who needed a bit more help across the board. This shows how a one-size-fits-all teaching approach might not work for everyone.

3.  **We Can Spot At-Risk Students Early:** The simple AI model I built did a decent job of predicting scores. It proves that we can use data to proactively find students who might need a little extra support before they start falling behind.
